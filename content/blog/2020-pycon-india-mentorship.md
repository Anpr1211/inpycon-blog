Do you have that one idea that can make the world “a better place”? (Silicon Valley Fans, Assemble!) 
Do you wish to submit a proposal but cannot figure out the flow of your talk or how to present it? 
We know it is not always easy to find the right words, but don’t you worry, the PyCon India Mentorship team is here just to help out with your proposal. 
Whether this is your first time or you are a seasoned professional who wants someone to take a look at their work, our mentorship team will guide you through the process and help you wherever required.
 
The go-to resource for prospective speakers of PyCon India, you can have a look at one of the blogs shared on the website which shares [tips on writing a “kickass” proposal](https://in.pycon.org/blog/2020/2020-workshop-cfp-announcement.html). 
Now, there are quite a few ways to reach out to us and you are free to use any of them. 
In case you want to know the best practices of writing a proposal or are looking to refine your proposal, a [call](https://meet.google.com/pot-jzjq-udn) is scheduled every Saturday 1500 to 1700 IST by the mentorship team which you can join and clear out your queries on a real-time basis. 
If the next Saturday seems distant and you need immediate help, you can join the [PyCon India Zulip](https://pyconindia.zulipchat.com/#) and drop a text in the [pre-cfp topic](https://pyconindia.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/245487-wg.2Fmentorship/topic/pre-cfp) of the mentorship stream. 
You will get a response from the team and will be asked to share a Google document with comment access to a mentor(in a private message), who will then help you polish the draft. 
If you don't get any response in 48 hours, please send a direct message to @siddharthvipul. And that’s all you need to do. 

And Pythonista, we feel you when you find the entire process of framing a proposal difficult. 
PyCon India is a community-driven event and our foremost priority is to help you learn and grow. 
So, keep your worries aside and just go for it. If you need any help, we are just a text away, literally!

P.S. Looking forward to reading your proposal.
